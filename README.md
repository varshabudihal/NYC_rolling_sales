# NYC_rolling_sales
## I used Random Forest algorithm and while solving this dataset a lot of pre-processing was required.
## In this problem it is required to predict the selling price of the properties using Machine Learning Model
## I got an accuracy of 0.13. I used Random forest as it gives a higher accuracy than most of the algorithms. I tried using linear regression but it was not as efficient as random forest. 
## You can replicate my result by importing NumPy and Pandas and then running the code in jupyter notebook
